# Aid Management Application
The final project I completed for course OOP244(Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming) in Seneca College during December 2019.
## Project Introduction
When disaster hits a populated area, the most critical task is to provide immediately affected people with what they need as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
This project completes an application that manages the list of goods that need to be shipped to the disaster area. The client application tracks the quantity of items needed, tracks the quantity on hand, and stores the information in a file for future use. 
The types of goods that need to be shipped are of two categories; 
•	Non-Perishable products, such as blankets and tents, which have no expiry date. We refer to products in this category as Product objects.
•	Perishable products, such as food and medicine, that have an expiry date. We refer to products in this category as Perishable.
